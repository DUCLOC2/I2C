## I2C Write Protocol Implementation

This project presents an RTL implementation of the **I2C write protocol**, in which
the **master initiates the communication and transmits data**, while the
**slave operates as a receiver**.  
The design strictly follows the standard **I2C specification** in terms of timing,
signal behavior, and message format.

### I2C Bus Signals
The I2C communication uses two shared lines:
- **SCL (Serial Clock)**: Clock signal generated by the master
- **SDA (Serial Data)**: Bidirectional open-drain data line

A **START condition** is generated when the master pulls **SDA low while SCL is high**,
indicating the beginning of an I2C transaction.  
A **STOP condition** is generated when the master releases **SDA from low to high
while SCL remains high**, signaling the end of the transaction and releasing the bus.
